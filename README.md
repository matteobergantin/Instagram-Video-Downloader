# Instagram Video Downloader

This simple script allows anyone to download video and audio files from Instagram.

## Update

I know create an extension to simplify the injection of the script.

## Usage:

Simply copy-paste the code contained in `main.js` inside the developer console.

Once the code has been pasted, press `CTRL+R` and `Enter` at the same time.

`CTRL+R` will reload the page and `Enter` will execute the code.

### WARNING: Generally it's an incredibly bad idea to execute ANY arbitrary untrusted Javascript code in the developer console, therefore, please execute ANY code ONLY if you UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES, and you TRUST THE SOURCE!
